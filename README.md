The dataset comes from Complete AI Solution Company.
The objective is to help the disaster response organizations provide the post related to the disaster that would be useful for them when taking the actions because social media become a real-time information source during some events. 

The dataset consists of text posted on social media such as Twitter, Facebook, and newsfeed that have been collected during the event or disaster. It has five variables, "id", "keywords", "location", "text" and "target". "target" here is labeled by the company manually. 
- "0" means the post might contain about the disaster but is not correlated with real disaster
- "1" means it correlates with the real disaster

This project will make the prediction more accurate by building a text classifier using a Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).
